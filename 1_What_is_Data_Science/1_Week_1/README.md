### Q. What is Data Science?

**Ans :**  Defining Data Science :

1. **Data Science is a process, not an event.** It is a process of **using data to understand different/various things**. It is **tool to understand the world.**

2. A **way to validate real-world issues, problems, models or hypothesis using the data** available to you.

3. It is the **art for uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind the data**.

4. Data can be **translated into a story, use storytelling to generate insights and using these insights we can make better strategies, choices for a company or an institution and can make better data driven decisions.**

5. It is a **field about processes and systems to extract data from various forms, of whether it is having un-structured (or) structured form**.

6. In layman terms, **data science is the study of data** like biological sciences is a study of biology, physical sciences, it's the study of physical reactions. Data is real, **data has real properties** and we need to study them and work on them.

7. Data science involves data and some science. The definition (or) the name coined in 80s and 90s when some professors were looking into the statistics curriculum, and they thought it would be better to call it as data science.
**Data science as one's attempt to work with data, to find anwsers to questions that they are exploring**. 
    - In a nutshell, it's more about data than it is about science.
    - Having data and having curiosity, to working with data and manipulating it, exploring it, analyzing it for getting anwsers to your questions from it it is called Data science.
    - Data science in modern context is a highly relevant field and previously we used to worry about lack of data but now we have data deluge. In past we didn't have algorithms and now, we have python, R, Machine learning, Deep learning having methods and algorithms. In past doftwares were expensive now, it is opensource and free. In past, we could'n'y store large amounts of data, now for a fraction of cost we can have gazillions of datasets for very low cost.

    - So tools to work with data, availibilty of data, ability to store and analyze data, its all cheap, it's all available, it's all ubiquitous.
