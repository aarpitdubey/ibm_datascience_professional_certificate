### Q. What is Data Science?

**Ans :**  Defining Data Science :

1. **Data Science is a process, not an event.** It is a process of **using data to understand different/various things**. It is **tool to understand the world.**

2. A **way to validate real-world issues, problems, models or hypothesis using the data** available to you.

3. It is the **art for uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind the data**.

4. Data can be **translated into a story, use storytelling to generate insights and using these insights we can make better strategies, choices for a company or an institution and can make better data driven decisions.**

5. It is a **field about processes and systems to extract data from various forms, of whether it is having un-structured (or) structured form**.

6. In layman terms, **data science is the study of data** like biological sciences is a study of biology, physical sciences, it's the study of physical reactions. Data is real, **data has real properties** and we need to study them and work on them.

7. Data science involves data and some science. The definition (or) the name coined in 80s and 90s when some professors were looking into the statistics curriculum, and they thought it would be better to call it as data science.
**Data science as one's attempt to work with data, to find anwsers to questions that they are exploring**. 
    - In a nutshell, it's more about data than it is about science.
    - Having data and having curiosity, to working with data and manipulating it, exploring it, analyzing it for getting anwsers to your questions from it it is called Data science.
    - Data science in modern context is a highly relevant field and previously we used to worry about lack of data but now we have data deluge. In past we didn't have algorithms and now, we have python, R, Machine learning, Deep learning having methods and algorithms. In past doftwares were expensive now, it is opensource and free. In past, we could'n'y store large amounts of data, now for a fraction of cost we can have gazillions of datasets for very low cost.

    - So tools to work with data, availibilty of data, ability to store and analyze data, its all cheap, it's all available, it's all ubiquitous.

### Fundamentals of Data Science

- In modern algorithms times, the vast quantity of data and it's availibility form massively varied sources. examples : log files, e-mail, social media, sales data, patient information files, sport performance data, sensor data, security cameras live data and many more besides,

- At the same times we have more data avialiable than ever and we  need the computing power to make useful analsis for this huge amount of data and new knowledge.

**Data science can helps Organizations :**
- Understand their environment. 
- Analyze existing issues.
- reavel previously hidden opportunities.

Data scientist use data analysis to add to the knowledge (value) of the organization (Business) by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business.

***What is the process of Data science?***

***Ans :*** Many organizations will use data science to focus on a specific problem that the organization and it is essential to clarify the question that the organization
that the organization wants answered. This is the first step of the data science process.
s.
> 1. Clarify the questions that the organization wants to be answered. data scientist are the curious people, who ask questions for clarifying the businness need

***What data do we need to solve the problem? and From where will that data come from***

***Ans :*** Data scientist can analyse structure an dun-structure data from many sources and, depending upon the nature of the problem, they analyze data in different ways

    Explore the patterns and outliers
    . some times it confirms what the oeganization suspects. but siometimes it is completely new knowledge, leading to a completely new apporach.

    When data reveals insights, the role of data scientist is to become a storyteller, communicating through results to the project stakeholder

    Datascientists can : 

        - Use powerful data visualization tools to help the stakeholder 
        
        - Understand the nature of the results.

        - And the recommended actions to take.

### Summary

- Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.

- There are  many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involve a little math, a little science, and a lot of curiosity about data.

- New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.

**Why data science is considered the sexiest job in the 21st century**, becuase of paying high salaries for skilled workers.

Organizations can leverages the atmost unlimited amount of data now available to them in a growing numbers of ways.

### Case study 1 Transportation - UBER

In transport, Uber collects real-time user data,

![](./images/1_uber_case_study.png)

for figuring out (or) to discover how many drivers are available,

if more needed, and if they should allow a surge charge to attract more drivers

Uber uses data

to put the right numbers of drivers in the right place, at the right time to riders who are willing to pay.

### Case study 2 Transportation - Toronto Transportation Commission.
<br>
The toronto transport commission has great strides in solving an old problem with traffic flowss, re-structing those flows in and around the city, using data science tools and analysis they have gathered data to better understand street car operations, and identify areas for interventions.
